# DERMAPEN

#### How does the DermaPen work?
Dermapen excels when used as a treatment for fine lines and wrinkles. As the Dermapen glides over your skin, it creates micro-point punctures in the skin, the majority of which are simply pushing your pores open temporarily. This is perceived by the body as damage, which stimulates the release of growth factors that trigger the production of collagen and elastin. Your skin reacts to any injury by initiating the healing process. You encourage your skin to continue healing through this micro-needling process.

#### How is the treatment administered?
DermaPen procedures are performed in a safe and precise manner with the use of the sterile DermaPen needle head.
What is the skins appearance after the treatment?
After the procedure your skin will be red and flushed in appearance in a similar way to moderate sunburn. You may also experience skin tightness and mild sensitivity to touch on the area being treated. This will diminish greatly after a few hours following treatments and within the next 24 hours the skin will be completely healed. After 3 days there is barely any evidence that the procedure has taken place.

#### How quickly are results visible?
Visible results of skin rejuvenation are generally seen after just 6-8 weeks following procedure and improve further over time.
