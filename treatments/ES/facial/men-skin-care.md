# MEN’S SKIN CARE


#### Do men need skin care?

Plain and simple, men need to care for their skin. Gone are the double standards that only women should cleanse, exfoliate and moisturize. Follow the tips for healthy looking male skin that defies the aging process.


#### Customized Facials

This cosmetic treatment can do more for your face than you could have achieved in a lifetime with your bathing soap. A facial nourishes the skin to give you a clear and well-hydrated complexion by exfoliating dead skin cells. This involves a variety of skin treatments such as steam, masks, peels and massage that are great for cleansing, exfoliation and extractions. A facial is given by a licensed esthetician and you can get this done in a beauty salon or at a spa. Remember that there are a variety of facials that you can choose from that cater to every skin need. Special facials are good for those with sensitive skin, bio-lift facials include treatment that target dark circles under the eye and AHA (Alpha Hydroxyl Acid) facials are recommended for people who have pigmented skin, and are prone to wrinkling easily. There are lots more but don’t panic if you don’t know exactly what to choose. The esthetician will gladly run through the options as well as recommend a suitable facial customized just for you.


Your treatment will be started with a deep cleansing, followed by a smoothing exfoliation. Tension will be released with a face, neck, and shoulder massage with Reflexology on the feet while your skin is rehydrated with a customized treatment masque.  Mens’ skin tends to be more sensitive to products because of shaving, we address that and promise we will make you a believer in skincare thereafter.

#### Did you know?

“Shaving your face every day has an enormous impact on your skin and is, unfortunately, at the root of most specifically male skin problems. Shaving does have its advantages: by acting as a sort of mini-massage, it boosts blood circulation and increases the skin’s oxygen supply. But improper shaving techniques will, over a period of time, not only nullify these benefits, but do serious damage to even the healthiest skin. They will certainly make you look less than your best when you walk out of your door in the morning.”
