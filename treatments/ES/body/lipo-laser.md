#### WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAT?

The fat is absorbed by your lymphatic system where it gets broken down. Next it is processed by the liver and gets converted into an energy source. Your body excretes the fat which leaves your body through your natural waste mechanisms.

#### DETOXIFICATION

In today’s modern world we are exposed to literally hundreds of chemicals and toxins. Each and every one of us can detoxification to clean these chemicals from our bodies. When used as an adjunct to the Lipo Laser, detoxification will maximize the benefits seen through treatment by helping to clear and process the fats that have been released.
