# Vibration platform

The energy is safely and effectively transferred to your body, stimulating every cell – your muscles, your bones and your soft tissue. The body reacts involuntarily with multiple muscle contractions in order to re-balance you on the plate. The quick movement of the platform also increases the “g” force of the body. As acceleration increases, your body will feel like it weighs more thus mimicking weight-bearing exercise. The result is less stress on the joints, ligaments and tendons when compared to regular resistance training.

## How does the vibration platform work?

Traditional whole body vibration machines work with what is called harmonic motion, which moves the user in an up and down motion on the platform with a relatively high amount of amplitude, which refers to the actual physical distance of movement.
The other common type of vibration plate machines utilize linear motion, which moves the platform forward and back and side to side and is often used to help build muscle strength.

## 10 MINUTES OF VIBRATION = 1 HOUR WORKOUT

When you workout you are targeting one muscle group at a time. However, when you are on a whole body vibration machine, 97% of all muscles are engaged and forced to respond at once just to keep you stable. Couple this with also working under a much greater “g” force, your health and fitness results are accelerated.

## Who should use the vibration platform?

There are health benefits possible for everyone from the very young to the elderly.

## Benefits:

- Increased muscle strength and flexibility
- Better core conditioning and stability
- Enhanced metabolism
- Reduction of the stress hormone cortisol
