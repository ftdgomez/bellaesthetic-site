# LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE MASSAGE

Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) massage is frequently recommended by plastic surgeons during the recovery process following surgery. This specialized form of massage is known to decrease recovery time and improve results, by reducing post-surgical swelling and fibrosis.

Benefits of lymphatic drainage range from a decrease in facial puffiness and a boost in immune function to a smoothing of cellulite and a soothing of muscle soreness.

## Good to Know:
Lymphatic drainage massage helps deliver cellular waste and microscopic villains like viruses and bacteria, which may cause cellulite, to the lymph nodes.

This drainage is essential because the lymphatic system lacks a pump of its own to transport the lymph through the body and must rely on movement, muscular contraction, and massage to flush the fluid.
