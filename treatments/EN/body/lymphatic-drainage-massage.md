It may sound like a medical procedure straight out of a science fiction movie, and spa clients may be turned off by its unglam name initially, but once they discover the benefits of lymphatic drainage massage, theyâ€™re hooked.

Benefits of lymphatic drainage range from a decrease in facial puffiness and a boost in immune function to a smoothing of cellulite and a soothing of muscle soreness.

After spa-goers have had a lymphatic drainage massage, they may 
never go back to a regular massage again!

#### The Story Behind the Treatment

The specific treatment, actually called manual lymph drainage (usually referred to as MLD) was developed in the 1930s in France by Emil Vodder, a Danish physical therapist, and his wife, Estrid, a naturopath.
Their method is still taught to spa therapists at Dr. Vodder 

Schools around the world though not all therapists use the Vodder method; some learn lymphatic drainage through a course in massage school, or through training in Ayurveda or naturopathy.
A 160-hour training is required for medical MLD.

#### Good to Know:

Lymphatic drainage massage helps deliver cellular waste and microscopic villains like viruses and bacteria, which may cause cellulite, to the lymph nodes.

These filter-like masses, which are found from head-to-toe, deliver this material to the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

This drainage is essential because the lymphatic system lacks a pump of its own to transport the lymph through the body and must rely on movement, muscular contraction, and massage to flush the fluid.
