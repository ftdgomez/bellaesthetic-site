## PRESSOTHERAPY

Pressotherapy is an invigorating compression therapy system that is used in our Spa. It utilizes the proven principles of manual lymphatic drainage to aid detox, slimming, toning, and reducing cellulite for every body type!

The treatment can reduce cellulite and volume in the abdomen, upper arms, buttocks, and legs — areas that are often affected by water retention and also targets fat when Far-Infrared is activated! This treatment is most efficient before starting body shaping treatments in persons with BMI is 35 and up, this can get you slimmed down with a couple of sessions and serves as a beginning base.


What are the benefits of body balancing using Pressotherapy?

Far Infrared Pressotherapy offers benefits in the following areas:

    Cellulite and skin tone: Boosting the supply of fresh, oxygenated blood to the tissues will result in a significant improvement in cellulite and skin quality, leaving it firm and toned.
    Slimming and body contouring: Improvements in the lymphatic and circulatory systems will lead to the rapid elimination of excess fluid, reducing volume and ‘puffiness’ in the treated areas in as little as a single treatment.
    Health and wellness: A healthy, well-functioning lymphatic system will have a positive impact on the immune, digestive and nervous systems as waste, toxins and pathogens are removed from the body more quickly and effectively.
    Fat Dissolving: Far Infrared works on fat tissue and dissolve fat cells with heat radiation. Regular inflation, deflation and variational air pressure can accelerate fat burning. Helps to speed up the blood circulation and promote metabolism.  The specific of far infrared technology is that it doesn’t heat up the surface of the body. Instead, it heats up the inner body that is 4 to 7 cm beneath the skin. This is wonderful because this is where the stubborn fat deposit and main blood vessels are located.
