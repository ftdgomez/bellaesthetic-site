# DERMAPLANE 

Dermaplaning is a method of exfoliation that uses a blade to scrape away dead skin and the fine hair on your face.

Good choice for people with:
- Extremely sensitive skin
- Rosacea
- Visible veins 
- Pregnant or nursing women 

After the treatment you can expect results immediately.

Dermaplane requires no downtime.
