 Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) can work wonders for getting rid of unwelcome hair on the face and body—these treatments are comfortable and require no downtime



5 Reasons to Try IPL Hair Removal

1. Less hair growth: IPL hair removal treatments get to the root of the problem by targeting the pigment and destroying the hair follicle.

2. It’s more effective: Ever miss a spot when shaving or waxing? Take the stress, mess, and inconvenience out of shaving and waxing by booking a more efficient IPL treatment.

3. No more razor burn: Say goodbye to red, itchy, and irritated skin by achieving smooth and silky results without a razor. 

4. Fewer ingrown hairs: When you shave, you cut the hair at its bluntest length, allowing the skin to trap it and cause ingrown hairs, infection, or even discoloration to the skin. By using advanced technology to destroy the whole hair follicle (as opposed to just nipping the hair at the surface level), IPL hair removal treatments eliminate the risk of stubborn ingrown hairs.

5. Save time: With a busy, hectic, and demanding lifestyle, it can be hard to find the time to shave or wax. Save time by booking an IPL treatment that will leave you with longer-lasting results! 


Skin Rejuvenation:

Intense pulsed light (IPL) skin rejuvenation is a type of light therapy used to treat these skin concerns. Unlike other light therapies, particularly those done with lasers, IPL causes minimal damage to the skin and recovery takes just a few days. This method of skin rejuvenation is safe, with minimal downtime. 

Benefits

    - IPL skin rejuvenation is a noninvasive skin care procedure that uses high-powered pulses of light to improve the appearance of skin.
    - This procedure also treats common skin concerns such as wrinkles, dark spots, unsightly veins or broken capillaries.
    - IPL is also effective in treating sun damage and scarring, and the redness associated with rosacea. 


IPL ACNE

Now there’s a new alternative to treating acne scarring: Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), which involves a series of short pulses of light. This light then targets the affected skin cells and thereby lessens the appearance of acne scars.
