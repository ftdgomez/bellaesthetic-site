# ANTI-AGING FACIAL

What is the Deep Cleaning Anti-Acne Facial treatment?
The Anti-Acne Facial is a purifying treatment that will deep clean your skin while penetrates through the pores, eliminating bacteria. Not all acne is the same. At Bella Esthetics  our approach is highly customized. Whether your acne is caused by high bacteria levels, hormonal changes, stress, or is simply a reaction to the environment, we will customize a facial to combat your acne. This treatment will include a deep cleanse, exfoliation, a chemical peel, and a detoxifying mask that will help draw out impurities and prevent periodic or ongoing breakouts. Having a skin analysis with our Acne Specialist is the most important step towards having clearer skin.

### IS ADULT ACNE COMMON?

Yes, very common. Both men and women see unexpected breakouts, texture changes or pigment changes as stress hormones, hormone changes with aging, and estrogen and testosterone levels fluctuate. Many women say their skin is never the same after a pregnancy and the hormone surges that go along with the experience.

How much time will it take?
At Bella Esthetics our Anti-Ageing Facial is for 80 minutes.  Skin analysis is carried out at the beginning of every facial treatment to establish the sensitivity of the skin to various ingredients.
