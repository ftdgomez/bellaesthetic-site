# Anti-acne facial

The Anti-Acne Facial is a purifying treatment that will deep clean your skin while penetrating through the pores, eliminating bacteria. Not all acne is the same. At Bella Esthetics our approach is highly customized. Whether your acne is caused by high bacteria levels, hormonal changes, stress, or is simply a reaction to the environment, we will customize a facial to combat your acne. This treatment will include a deep cleanse, exfoliation, a chemical peel, and a detoxifying mask that will help draw out impurities and prevent periodic or ongoing breakouts. Having a skin analysis with our master esthetician is the most important step towards having clearer skin.

## Is adult acne common?

Yes, very common. Both men and women see unexpected breakouts, texture changes or pigment changes as stress hormones, hormone changes with aging, and estrogen and testosterone levels fluctuate. Many women say their skin is never the same after a pregnancy and the hormone surges that go along with the experience.
