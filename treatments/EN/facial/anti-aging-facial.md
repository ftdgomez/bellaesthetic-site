## What is an anti-aging facial?

This treatment attempts to halt the ageing process by working deep within the dermis layers, where collagen proteins can be found.
Anti-aging facials use products and techniques designed to slow the ageing process, brighten skin, and reduce wrinkles.  If you’re on the quest for younger-looking skin, you’re in luck. 

## Why get an anti-aging facial?

If you want to fight the war against wrinkles, enlisting in an anti-ageing facial treatment at Bella Esthetics is a good strategy. Facials are designed to rejuvenate skin with all elements—from exfoliation (sloughing away dead, skin-dulling cells) to moisturizing to massage (improving circulation)—acting together to improve skin’s texture.  An anti-aging facial is an effective preventative measure when it comes to the ageing process, and is good option if you want to skip the surgery for something less invasive.

## How much time will it take?
At Bella Esthetics our Anti-Ageing Facial is for 80 minutes.  Skin analysis is carried out at the beginning of every facial treatment to establish the sensitivity of the skin to various ingredients.
