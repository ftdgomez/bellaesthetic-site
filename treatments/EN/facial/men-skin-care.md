# Men's skin care

## Customized Facials

A facial nourishes the skin to give you a clear and well-hydrated complexion by exfoliating dead skin cells. This involves a variety of skin treatments such as steam, masks, peels and massage that are great for cleansing, exfoliation and extractions. The esthetician will gladly run through the options as well as recommend a suitable facial customized just for you.
Your treatment will be started with a deep cleansing, followed by a smoothing exfoliation. Mens’ skin tends to be more sensitive to products because of shaving.

## Did you know?

“Shaving your face every day has an enormous impact on your skin and is, unfortunately, at the root of most specifically male skin problems. Shaving does have its advantages: by acting as a sort of mini-massage, it boosts blood circulation and increases the skin’s oxygen supply. But improper shaving techniques will, over a period of time, not only nullify these benefits, but do serious damage to even the healthiest skin.”
